About Virtual Networking Blocks technology - GEN

Features
--------

- Arbitrary packet injection into graph.
- Packets generated from templates provided by a control message and/or hooks
  input.
- Configurable transmission rate and burst size.

Synopsis
--------

Data entering from hooks in_* is passed asynchronously (duplicated) to hook
out. Packets can also be spontaneously generated by providing a template with
the setpacket command.

Only a single packet can be buffered at once per hook, thus packets may be
lost if they are replaced before they are transmitted.

Each hook may be configured to repeat packets at a given rate (bursts per
second) and burst size. A zero rate will send a single burst, a zero burst
size will disable traffic generation entirely.
